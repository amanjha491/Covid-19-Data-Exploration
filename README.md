# Covid-19-Data-Exploration
This project focuses on the exploration and analysis of COVID-19 data using various SQL skills. The aim is to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic on different regions and populations. The project covers a wide range of metrics, including infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination coverage.

Skills Used:

Joins: Combining data from multiple tables, such as CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations, to link relevant information.
CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Creating temporary result sets to enhance query readability and efficiency.
Temp Tables: Storing intermediate results to facilitate complex calculations.
Window Functions: Performing calculations over specific partitions or ranges of data.
Aggregate Functions: Computing summary statistics, such as total infection counts and death rates.
Creating Views: Storing reusable queries for later visualization and analysis.
Converting Data Types: Ensuring data consistency by converting data types when necessary.
The analysis includes various queries to explore:

The likelihood of dying if contracting COVID-19 in specific countries.
The percentage of the population infected with COVID-19.
Countries with the highest infection and death rates compared to their population.
Breakdown of metrics by continent.
Global numbers of new cases, total cases, and death percentages.
Analysis of total population vs. vaccinations.
This project provides practical insights into data exploration and demonstrates the application of SQL techniques to real-world data.
